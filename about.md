### About us
We are just a bunch of geeks interested in applying Signal Prcoessing and Machine Learning tools to Healthcare and Radar research areas. But we are open to solving other useful problems as well. At present, we are trying to arrange a date between theoretically sound signal processing techniques (like Compressive Sensing) and Deep Learning. We'll let you know how it goes through this website.
