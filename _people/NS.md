I'm an enthusiastic Graduate student at The Ohio State University.
I like to learn intriguing new things all the time. I have always been interested in how technology around us works. My childhood interest in engineering started with Cars followed by self-driving vehicles and now matured into designing Machine Learning Algorithms in general. Get in touch if you'd like to collaborate, know more or just chit-chat :D
