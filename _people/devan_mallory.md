### Bio

Hello! I am an undergraduate student at the Ohio State University majoring in Computer Science and music. My research interests are primarily in medical embedded systems, both in the modern sense (non-invasive sensors) and in the future sense (neuromorphics and implants),
as well as Symbolic Artificial Intellegence, particularly in new expanded predicate-based systems and algorithms such as non-axiomatic logic (NAL). I have a strong belief that combining these 2 things together will
allow medical research to improve immensly. I work as an undergraduate research assistant, helping to deploy tensorflow lite micro models on microcontrollers in the form of wearables, and hope to conduct research simalar to this in the future.
