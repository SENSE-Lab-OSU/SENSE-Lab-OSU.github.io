<p><a href="http://koerding.com/">Konrad Kording</a> runs his lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
Konrad is interested in the question of how the brain solves the credit assignment problem and
similarly how we should assign credit in the real world (through causality). In extension
of this main thrust he is interested in applications of causality in biomedical research.
Konrad has trained as student at ETH Zurich with Peter Konig, as postdoc at UCL London with Daniel
Wolpert and at MIT with Josh Tenenbaum. After a decade at Northwestern University he is now
PIK professor at UPenn.</p>
