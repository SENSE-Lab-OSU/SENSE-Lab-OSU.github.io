<p>After graduating from Williams College with a degreee in physics, teaching high school chemistry for a year in Mexico, and obtaining a master’s in nanoscale simulation and biomaterials at Northwestern, I joined this awesome lab for computational neuroscience! I’m all about nonlinear life trajectories, which is fair, since the brain is nonlinear too.</p>
