<p>I do biological and computational investigations of the visuomotor system. Currently pursuing two directions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>WTFEF? Trying to decipher the frontal eye fields. Our current approach is to record from many FEF cells while monkeys search for targets in natural scenes.</li>
  <li>Investigating the role of the tectoreticulospinal tract during reflexive orienting. Super excited about this, but it is still very much in development stages. More details later.</li>
</ol>

Fascinated by Polynesian history. Spent 2 yrs in Dominican Republic as a LDS missionary. Studied philosophy (primarily existential phenomenology) during my undergrad. Blissfully married, with one perfect daughter and one lazy weimaraner named Darwin.</p>
